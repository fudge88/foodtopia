## User story

AS a user when I GO on the app,

I expect to FIND a main page with a navigation bar on the top containing the project LOGO and three links, Recipes, Diet and My Fav.

ALSO a search bar with an Input Box, a Search Button and three filters. Diet, Intolerances and Cuisines.

I expect to FIND on the bottom of the page a footer.

When I CLICK on the Recipes link,

I should be REDIRECT to the recipes page, Where I expect to SEE a carousel on the top showing recipes that may interest the user, a filter button and card-recipes containing:

- a background image of the dish,
- the recipe title,
- the time and the portions,
- the nutritional info. ( )

When I CLICK on the card-recipe,

I EXPECT to be relocated to the specific recipe page,

Where I WANT to see:

- the recipe name,
- the image of the respective recipe,
- a box with the instructions of how to cook the recipe,
- one option button (add to Favorites),
- a card showing the time, the portions and the ingredients,
- box with the nutritional info. ( ),
- a carousel at the bottom with recipes that may interest the user.

When I CLICK on “add to Favorites”,

I EXPECT my recipe be added to “My favorites”.

When I CLICK on Diet,

I should SEE a scroll bar with the different dietary types ( )

When I CLICK on My Fav,

I EXPECT to be relocated to a page presenting all my favorites recipes cards,
When I HOVER over the search bar,

I EXPECT my previous searches been displayed.

When I CLICK on a previous search,

I should be TAKEN to that specific recipe.

Also, I should be able to SEARCH recipes ideas based on the choices I “ticked” on the dropdown search bar. (e.g., Italian food, vegetarian, gluten free)

When I INPUT something,

I should be RELOCATED to the menu page with related recipes to the specific search.
